# EQCX Launches Canada's First Zero-Fee CAD-USD Currency Exchange Platform

## New Platform Uses Web3 Technology to Eliminate Hidden Bank Fees for Canadian Currency Conversions

**TORONTO, August 2025** – EQCX (Equivalent Currency Exchange), a new financial technology platform, today announced the launch of Canada's first currency exchange service offering **true 0.00% foreign exchange fees** on both CAD-to-USD and USD-to-CAD conversions for members. Built with advanced Web3 technology, EQCX eliminates the hidden fees that traditional banks charge on currency conversions, saving Canadians hundreds or thousands of dollars annually.

Traditional Canadian banks charge between 2-3% on currency conversions in either direction, with many adding service fees and poor exchange rates. For someone converting $10,000 CAD to USD, typical bank fees range from $200-$300. EQCX's membership model eliminates these costs completely, while non-members still save significantly by paying only a fraction of what the second-lowest cost provider charges.

**"Canadians have been paying unnecessarily high fees for basic currency conversion that should cost almost nothing,"** said [CEO Name], Chief Executive Officer of EQCX. **"Whether you're earning USD income, buying from US suppliers, traveling south, or investing in American markets, these fees add up quickly. Our Web3 technology enables us to offer true zero-fee conversions for members, while non-members still save significantly compared to any other option."**

## Real Savings for Real Canadians

Early users have already experienced substantial savings across common use cases:

**"As a freelancer with US clients, I was losing $200+ monthly in conversion fees. EQCX membership pays for itself in weeks, and now I keep more of what I earn."** 
*– Sarah Chen, Digital Marketing Consultant, Vancouver*

**"My business buys inventory from US suppliers monthly. The conversion fees were eating into our margins. Even as a non-member, EQCX costs a fraction of what we paid before."**
*– Michael Rodriguez, E-commerce Entrepreneur, Toronto*

**"We spend winters in Florida and were paying $600+ annually just in currency conversion fees. EQCX has eliminated that completely."**
*– Jennifer Kim, Financial Advisor, Calgary*

## Web3 Technology Enables Better Rates

EQCX leverages cutting-edge Web3 technology and advanced liquidity networks to offer:

- **Zero conversion fees** for members on both CAD-to-USD and USD-to-CAD
- **Significant savings** for non-members compared to all alternatives
